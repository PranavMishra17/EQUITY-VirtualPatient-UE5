# EQUITY - Enhancing QUality of Instruction using TechnologY

## Overview

EQUITY is a virtual patient system designed to help medical learners identify, reflect on, and mitigate racial biases in healthcare settings. This innovative educational tool leverages advanced gaming technology to create realistic clinical scenarios that challenge learners to recognize and address biases in medical decision-making.

## Technology Stack

- **Unreal Engine 5**: Core development platform for the simulation environment
- **NVIDIA Omniverse**: Used for generating AI-driven animations and interactions
- **Metahuman Creator**: Employed to create photorealistic patient avatars
- **Inkl Scripting**: Powers the narrative branching and decision trees
- **Blueprint Visual Scripting**: Used for gameplay mechanics and simulation logic

## Project Structure

- `/InkpotDemo`: Core project files
- `/InkpotDemo 5.3`: Project files compatible with Unreal Engine 5.3
  - `/Build`: Compiled project builds
  - `/Binaries`: Compiled binary files
  - `/Config`: Configuration files for the project
  - `/Content`: Assets, textures, materials, and other content
  - `/Intermediate`: Temporary files generated during project building
  - `/Plugins`: Custom and third-party plugins
  - `/Source`: Source code files
  - `/StorySource`: Narrative scripts and dialogue trees

## Features

- **Realistic Virtual Patients**: Metahuman-created diverse patient models with accurate representations
- **Bias-Revealing Scenarios**: Carefully crafted clinical situations that subtly present opportunities for bias
- **Branching Dialogue System**: Dynamic conversations that adapt based on learner choices
- **Performance Analytics**: Tracking system that monitors decision patterns and potential bias indicators
- **Reflection Tools**: Post-scenario debriefing mechanisms that encourage self-reflection
- **Educational Resources**: Integrated learning materials on healthcare disparities and bias mitigation
